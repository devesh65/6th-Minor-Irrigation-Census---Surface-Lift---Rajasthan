6TH-MINOR-IRRIGATION-CENSUS-SURFACE-LIFT-RAJASTHAN

Thrilled to share my latest Data Science project – Decoding Rajasthan’s Surface Lift Irrigation Schemes through the 6th Minor Irrigation Census! 💧📊
🌾 Project Overview:
 This project dives into the 6th Minor Irrigation Census data, specifically focusing on Surface Lift Irrigation schemes in Rajasthan — a critical component in ensuring sustainable water access for agriculture in arid regions. With rich, real-world data on scheme ownership, energy usage, water distribution, and seasonal irrigation, I aimed to uncover patterns that can drive smarter policy and infrastructure decisions.
🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:
 📌 Python | Pandas | NumPy | Seaborn | Matplotlib
✨ Key Highlights:
 ✅ Cleaned and pre-processed complex multi-feature datasets
 ✅ Performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 ✅ Built compelling visualizations including:
 🔹 Heatmaps – to identify correlations between irrigation performance indicators
 🔹 Dot & Bar Charts – for comparative study across ownership, scheme types, and usage
 🔹 Line & Stacked Graphs – to track seasonal irrigation trends and lifting device efficiency
🎯 Key Insights Explored:
 🚜 Ownership Patterns – Analysis based on gender, social status, and scheme ownership type
💦 Water Lifting Technologies – Studied device types, energy sources, and horsepower utilization
 📈 Utilization vs. Capacity – Compared IPC (Irrigation Potential Created) vs. IPU (Utilized) across seasons
 💰 Investment Analysis – Evaluated construction, machinery, and maintenance costs
 🌍 Geographic Reach – Visualized scheme spread across blocks, villages, and command areas
📉 Insights & Impact:
 🔍 Found areas with significant underutilization despite heavy investment
 📊 Detected clear disparities in scheme access among social groups
 💡 Suggested potential improvements in energy efficiency and seasonal coverage
 🛠️ Uncovered gaps in infrastructure that could inform future irrigation planning
🧠 Learning Outcomes:
 This project sharpened my skills in handling government datasets, data cleaning, and translating data into real-world narratives. More importantly, it showed how data can help build equitable, efficient, and sustainable irrigation strategies for rural India.
📢 Water is life — and data is power. Let’s use both wisely. Open to connect with professionals working in agriculture, water governance, data-driven policy, and rural sustainability. 🌱🤝
